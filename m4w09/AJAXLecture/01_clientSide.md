Client Side rendering vs Server Side rendering?

TinyApp - SSR - Express-server.js and/or index.js -Where express.js
Tweeter - CS - Scripts, to manipulate the DOM

What is the difference?
Rendering in the Server
Rendering everything in the Client (Browser, the Clients Computer)

Benefits? Downsides?
