How are projects managed?


Traditional(Waterfall) vs Agile workflow

Waterfall - A specific deadline (Finals)

- Each piece is worked on one at a time to launch the project all at once V1 - V2
- Prone to roadblocks
- More solid intial planning
- Can be harder to split tasks

Agile - Existing products/apps

- Iterative approach
- Dynamic
- Designed to deliver a product in smaller, faster stages / sprints V1 - V1.1 -V1.2 etc
- It is very Scrum compatible
- Individuals/interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
