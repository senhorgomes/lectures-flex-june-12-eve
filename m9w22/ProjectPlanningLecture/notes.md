        - Team roles:

            Product Owner
            Development Team/Scrum Team
    - Scrum meetings
        -Daily meeting:
            What did you complete yesterday?
            Are there any roadblocks? What is preventing me from doing my job correctly
- Sprints, is a timeframe where we estimate how long a piece of a project will take us. How long will it take us to get from point A to point B how do you plan for your project? What piece can be project ready during this spring? Must have a feature production ready within this time frame


Agile is a scrum-comptaible approach to project management
    - Fast-paced small sprints
    - Lots of versions
    - Optimizes for client feedback
    - Manifesto:
        - Individual / Interactions over Tools and Processes
        - Working Software over comporehensive Documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotation
        - Responding to change over following  a set plan

- Waterfall (Traditional Project Plan)
 - Quoting and planning a project upfront(Heres a project idea, itll cost so and so, and take this long)
 - Each piece is usually worked on one at a time
 - This is where Roadblocks can be concieved
 - More solid / rigid initial planning
 - Less chance for feedback from client
 - Can be harder to split up tasks
 Most common approach is waterfall, waterfall is what you used for your projects
